"""PreToolUse inline-exploration budget.

The routing policy allows one-shot deterministic commands in the main loop
but wants iterative discovery delegated to cheap workers. This guard makes
that deterministic: after FRUGAL_INLINE_BUDGET search-type tool calls within
one user prompt, further ones are denied with a pointer to scout/extractor.
A foreground (blocking) Agent call resets the budget; a background one does
not, so inline work racing a background worker still hits the wall. Subagent
tool calls are never counted or
blocked. Fail-open by design: any parse problem allows.
